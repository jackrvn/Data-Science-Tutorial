        "# An Introduction to Data Science:\n",
        "## (Through Spotify!)\n",
        "\n",
        "![Spotify cover photo](https://github.com/jackrvn/Data-Science-Tutorial/blob/main/images/myriam-jessier-eveI7MOcSmw-unsplash.jpg?raw=1)\n",
        "\n",
        "### Have you ever wondered how search engines like [Google](www.google.com), work?\n",
        "Or how [Netflix](www.netflix.com) knows what shows and movies to show you? How about how the [TikTok](www.tiktok.com) For You Page seems to be *that* accurate??\n",
        "\n",
        "To put it simply, all of the above has been made possible because of something called Data Science - which is what we're going to start learning a little bit about through this notebook!\n",
        "\n",
        "### But hold up - what actually *is* data?\n",
        "That's a great question! It may seem fairly trivial, but to put it plainly, data is just a collection of information, facts or figures that can usually be described as being ***'empirical'*** (that's just a fancy word for saying we gathered the data through observation). Usually this information is about a paricular topic, and can be either ***'qualitative'*** (meaning it's *not* number based, i.e. answers to the question \"what is your favourite cereal?\") or ***'quantitative'*** (meaning it *is* number based, such as answers to the question \"how many times a week do you eat cereal for breakfast?\").\n",
        "\n",
        "### So, doesn't that mean *everything* is 'data'? - not quite.\n",
        "What makes data different from just any information, is whether or not we choose to ***save*** that information in some way. So although just talking to your classmates about their cereal eating habits isn't considered data; if you were to then go around your class and ask everyone pre-defined questions like \"do you prefer cookie crisp or coco pops?\", before writing down everyone's answers (with their permission) - that would in fact be considered as collecting data!\n",
        "\n",
        "![Bowl of Cereal](images/freestocks-N56qCB6v4Kw-unsplash.jpg \"I'm personally more of a cheerios fan myself\")\n",
        "\n",
        "### But Netflix has never asked me questions about what shows I like?\n",
        "In this day and age with the internet and smartphones, there is an abundance of ways that data can be both collected and used without requiring us to directly ask people questions. Most apps and websites you will come across nowadays will record everything you do, without you even needing to be logged in.\n",
        "\n",
        "In the case of Netflix, they can make recommendations for shows based off of the type of shows you've watched before, and whether or not you pressed the 'like' or 'dislike' button for them. The recommendations they make might also not be related to you directly, but based off of what other people in your area, who have similar tastes to you, have enjoyed.\n",
        "\n",
        "The point is, Netflix saves all of this data about you and every other user on their platform so that they can create a more personalised experience for everyone. And they do this *constantly*, along with basically every other platform, which is why all of them seem to know so much about you.\n",
        "\n",
        "### That... seems kinda messed up...\n",
        "It can seem that way, especially if the data collected is without your permission or is used in a malicious way. However, for the most part, data can be incredibly useful. Imagine if Netflix only ever suggested old war films to you? If you're someone who loves a good WW2 film, then I'm sure you'd be delighted! But it wouldn't make for a great user experience if you're someone who loves watching sitcoms.\n",
        "\n",
        "The thing you have to remember as well, is companies want you to keep using their platform so that they can make money - and the number one way they can do that, is by personalising your experience. Think about it, how many times have you gone onto Netflix, not neccessarily knowing what you wanted to watch, but knew that you would be able to find something? It's because of this that you still continue to pay for a service like Netflix, and providing their income.\n",
        "\n",
        "### So is that all data is used for? Why do I need to learn about it?\n",
        "Not at all! Like we discusssed before, data can be used for a variety of things in a variety of fields. For example, we use data science in an area like Medicine to help us understand how patients may experience symptoms for a specific disease. The government also uses data science in the form of things like the [census](https://census.gov.uk/), to help understand information about the general public such as 'how many people under the age of 21 is there?' or 'how many people are a part of the LGBTQ+ community?'.\n",
        "\n",
        "No matter what career you end up going into, chances are that data science will be relevant to it in some way. Beyond this however, having even a basic undertsanding of how data is collected and analysed is essential for being able to understand various aspects of our society. As well as being able to understand how companies actually collect and use your data when you agree to their terms and conditions; understanding data science also helps with things like spotting fake news.\n",
        "\n",
        "Point is, data is constantly being taken from us and used around us - so why wouldn't you learn about it?\n",
        "\n",
        "## Discussion: What are some positive and negative ways data can be and has been used in the real world?\n",
        "Take a minute to discuss with your classmates (or with yourself, I don't judge) the above, as well as these follow up questions:\n",
        "* What are some of the long and short term impacts malicicous use of data can have?\n",
        "* What are some other examples where data has had a positive impact on the products and services ou have used?\n",
        "* How do you think your data from those products and services are used?\n",
        "\n",
        "![data.jpg](https://github.com/jackrvn/Data-Science-Tutorial/blob/main/images/data.jpg?raw=1)\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "### How will this \\* *wildly gestures at screen* \\* thing help me learn about data science?\n",
        "I'm so glad you asked! What you are currently looking at, is something called a an interactive notebook Jupyter Notebook - which data scientists absolutely *love* because you can code in it annd immediately see the results in a clean format. Although what you're doing right now is reading some text, we are going to be able to use this interface to actually write our own code and do some data science ourselves!\n",
        "\n",
        "In this lesson, we are going to be going over some of the basics of how data science works, and to do that we're going to use a dataset of 170,000+ songs from Spotify and see if we can make some interesting analysis from it. So lets go!\n",
        "\n",
        "### How does an interactive notebook work?\n",
        "Throughout this notebook you will see a series of 'cells', which either contain text or code. Right now, you are reading a **markdown cell**, which just holds text/images which isn't really meant to be changed.\n",
        "\n",
        "The interesting part is the **code cells**, which will let you write and run, you guessed it, code! Now when you first open up a notebook, none of these cells will have been run so you will have to do that yourself whenever you see one.\n",
        "\n",
        "So, let's test one out. **Double click** the following cell, and change the variable *a* to complete the sentence. Once you're done, you can **press Ctrl + Enter** to run the cell!"

        "Part of a data scientist's go to tool is a Python library called **Pandas** - I know what you're thinking, but sadly this has nothing to do with the adorable animals.\n",
        "\n",
        "If you're not familiar with the concept of a coding library, you can think of it as being a set of code that someone else wrote for you to use. Basically, we realised at one point that there were a *bunch* of functions and other stuff that we used *a lot*, and it would take way too much time to implement this stuff over and over again. So, to make our lives easier and faster, libraries were created so you wouldn't have to keep re-inventing the wheel (plus this way they are realllyy fast and much easier to use than anything we could have made.\n",
        "\n",
        "So what is Pandas? At its base, pandas is a library which offers a really nice way to be able to import, store and analyse our data specifically for datascience purposes - and most data scientists really could not live without it. So lets import it into our notebook, and start using it!"

        "### Has song length changed in the last 10 years?\n",
        "As we saw in the previous task, looking at the average song length over just the last 3 years didn't really tell us much. To get some actually interesting information, we will need to consider song length over a longer period of time... So let's try the last 10 years instead!\n",
        "\n",
        "This time, since we're dealing with a data **over a longer period of time**, let's use a line plot instead of a bar chart. This way, it makes it a lot easier for us as data scientists to see if we can spot any **trends** in our data- and just to be clear, I'm not talking about TikTok trends. When we talk about a trend in datascience, we mean any patterns or a particular direction our data might be moving.  If you're still not sure what I mean, don't worry, it will become pretty clear in a bit!\n",
        "\n",
        "Now since we would have to calculate 10 years worth of data to be able to create this graph, this can get pretty tedious and tiring to write out the same line of code 10 times. So, lets automate it!\n",
        "\n",
        "If you have some experience in python, or any programming language really, then you are likely already familiar with the concept of a **for loop** - so we're gonna use one of those to calculate the mean song duration for each year, for us!\n",
        "\n",
        "We'll start by making a list which contains all the years from the last 10 years (so in my case, this is 2010-2020). While we could write out every single year out by hand and put it into a list, we can instead use the **range(start,end)** function to do this for us! We will then store this as the variable **last10years**. We should note, since a line plot is a **continuous** plot, instead of a static plot (meaning the graph doesn't have any breaks in it), this time we want our years to remain as **integers**, not strings. This also means that we can use the list **last10years** for our x axis too! Another important thing to remember also, is that the range function is **exclusive, not inclusive**, meaning we will need to actually do **range(2010, 2021)** in order to get a list from 2010 to 2020 (otherwise it will only go to 2019!).\n",
        "\n",
        "Like we did with the barchart, we will also want to make another list **last10years_duration_means** which will contain all the song duration means from the last 10 years.\n",
        "\n",
        "Our for loop will then loop through each year in **last10years**, and grab the mean for that year in a similar way to what we did before. However, this time we want to also make sure that we are appending the resulting mean in our list **last10years_duration_means**.\n",
        "\n",
        "Finally, we can use **plt.plot(x,y)** to create our line plot, where x = **last10years** and y = **last10years_duration_means**."

        "At the end, you're going to write up a mini report summarising all the findings  you got from your data analysis of danceability, including pictures of all the graphs you have made. You should also include the analysis we have done on duration vs danceability, as well as year vs danceability too. Then at the end, come up with a conclusion as to what exactly makes a song danceable according to your results, before sharing the findings with your class!\n",
